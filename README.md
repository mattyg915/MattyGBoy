MattyG Boy

MattyG Boy is (will be) a very basic emulator for the original Nintendo GameBoy. I'm creating it mostly because I learned the basics of how emulators work somewhat recently and I want to prove to myself that I can do something like this that interests me a lot.

This readme, like this project, is in its infancy and I will add to it as I make headway in the project.
